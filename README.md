# Java-Advanced-SoftUni January 2020

The Java Advanced course covers working with the Java language. In the course you will learn to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, create template classes. Attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the main tool based on it - Stream API for processing data flows. The development environment that will be used by the coaching team is IntelliJ Idea 2020, but each student is free to use tools of their choice.
